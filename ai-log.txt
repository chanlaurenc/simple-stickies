Commit 2 (Render Notes)
    PROMPT: For Commit 2, I need to temporarily hard-code two notes in mounted() to test v-for and v-model. What is the correct object structure for each note according to the assignment?
    RESPONSE: 
        Each note must be an object with this structure:
        { id: String (or Number), text: String }

        Example:
        this.stickies = [
        { id: 1, text: "Test note 1" },
        { id: 2, text: "Another note" }
        ];
    WHAT I USED/CHANGED: Used the required object structure. Inserted into mounted() for testing.

Commit 3 (Add and delete notes)
    PROMPT: For Commit 3, I need to implement addStickie() and deleteStickie(id). How should I generate a unique id with a fallback if crypto.randomUUID() is not available?
    Why do we need to use filter() with reassignment when deleting in Vue?
    RESPONSE:
        To generate a unique id, use crypto.randomUUID() if it exists. 
        If it is not available, use a fallback such as String(Date.now() + Math.random()).

        Example:
        let id;

        if (crypto && crypto.randomUUID) {
        id = crypto.randomUUID();
        } else {
        id = String(Date.now() + Math.random());
        }

        For deleting:
        Use Array.filter() to return a new array that excludes the matching id.
        Reassign the result back to the array so Vue reactivity detects the change.

        Example:
        this.stickies = this.stickies.filter(s => s.id !== id);
    WHAT I USED/CHANGED: Used the UUID fallback logic and filter + reassignment pattern. Wrote the full addStickie() and deleteStickie() methods and tested adding and deleting multiple notes.
